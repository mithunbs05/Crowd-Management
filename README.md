# 🚶‍♂️ Real-Time People Counting using YOLOv11 + NVIDIA DeepStream + nvdsanalytics

## 📘 Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered people counting system** using **YOLOv11** integrated with **NVIDIA DeepStream SDK**.  
The system uses **line-crossing analytics** to count people entering and exiting a specific region in a video or live camera stream.

By combining YOLOv11’s detection accuracy and DeepStream’s high-performance video pipeline, this solution can handle **real-time analytics** on multiple video streams with **GPU acceleration**.

## 🧭 Project Scope

### 🎯 Objectives
- Detect **people** from live or recorded video streams using **YOLOv11**.
- Count **entries and exits** based on **line-crossing logic**.
- Display analytics results (counts, bounding boxes, tracking IDs) on the output video.
- Build a scalable DeepStream pipeline for **edge AI and smart surveillance** applications.

### 🧩 Applications
- 🏢 In temples and heritage building — monitoring crowd movement.
- 🛍️ Retail Analytics — customer flow tracking.
- 🏫 Campus Safety — entry/exit tracking.
- 🚇 Transportation Hubs — crowd management.
- 🚗 Parking or toll booth monitoring.
